Data mining, as a fundamental pillar for Artificial Intelligence, employs pattern recognition technologies, as well as statistical and mathematical techniques.\r\n- Natural language processing (NLP) enables organisations to build machines that understand and respond to text or voice data—and respond with text or speech of their own—in much the same way humans do. By means of the parsing and semantic interpretation of text or voice data, it allows machines to learn, analyse, and understand human language.\r\n- Machine learning enables organisations to build applications learning from data and improving their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so.",
